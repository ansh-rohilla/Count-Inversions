# Count-Inversions
The provided C++ code is a modified version of Merge Sort that efficiently counts the number of inversions in an array. An inversion is a pair of elements (a[i], a[j]) such that i &lt; j but a[i] > a[j]. The code uses a divide-and-conquer approach, similar to standard Merge Sort, to both sort the array and count these inversions.
